we could have nspcs set their parent
and just not bother setting parent for the user one



  #! value
    ensure type is in namespace

  #! function
    ensure rettype and type of any arguments are in namespace

  #! class
    ensure parent is in namespace
    iterate through functions, types and values







    #! NOTE: we may want to resolve for template?
