Gwion is a programming language, aimed at making music

**strongly** inspired by [ChucK](http://chuck.stanford.edu/), but adding a bunch *high-level* features;
	  templating, first-class functions and more.  

It aims to be simple, small,
 [fast](https://Gwion.github.io/Gwion/#Benchmarks/),
 [extendable](https://github.com/Gwion/Gwion-plug) and [embeddable](https://github.com/fennecdjay/Gwion/blob/master/src/main.c#L18-L31).

Checkout the community, and join us on discord: https://discord.gg/KmHqbTKSmS.
You can also check this very nice server about programming language devlopment: https://discord.gg/4Kjt3ZE,
since a lot of improvements to gwion are discussed there.

Please also consider taking the (WIP) [*tour*](https://github.com/Gwion/GwionTour) 

## Build
### Download the source

``` sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Gwion/Gwion
cd Gwion
make
```

### Configuring (optional)
You can get a list of config files to tweak with
``` sh
find . -name "config.mk"
```

Please rebuild to take your change into account.
```
make -C util clean
make -C ast  clean
make clean
make
```

> Besides developer options, you migth want to check *USE_DOUBLE*, in util/config.mk, which set the floating point size (float or double).
> Note that the option you choose must match how you built your soundpipe library (more on soundpipe later). 

## Executing your first code (hello_world.gw):

This assumes you have successfully compiled gwion. To build follow [these steps](#build) . To check, if the build was successfully run
```
./gwion
```
if this gives out some error, there were problems with your compilation.
Try building again, and open a [issue](https://github.com/Gwion/Gwion/issues)
if the problem persists. We would love to help you out.  
If you see no errors, Congratulations!! You have successfully compiled gwion, and can move ahead.

Create a new file "hello_world.gw" in the same directory.(You are free to use any command)
```
touch hello_world.gw
```

Open this file using your favourite text editor
```
vim hello_world.gw
```

Add the following lines to print "Hello World" (Note the semicolon at the end)
```
<<< "Hello World" >>>;
```

Save and exit the file(:wq in vim). Use the following command to run your first gwion program
```sh
./gwion hello_world.gw
```
Congratulations!! You ran your first gwion program.

## Making Sound

_This section is currently very Linux-centric. We are working to improve that. Pull requests welcome!_

Gwion relies on plugins for most of its language features, including all those that make sound. Plugins are located in the subdirectories of
`plug`. To get some sounds going under linux using jack sound server, you can build the plugins `Jack`, `Soundpipe`, and `Modules`. Make sure you have Jack installed.

Start by downloading the sources
```
git submodule update plug
cd plug
```

Starting from the Gwion base directory, to build `Jack`:
```
cd plug/Jack
make
```
This will give you a shared object file, `Jack.so`. The default place Gwion will look for plugins is in a subdir of your home directory 
named `.gwplug`. So create that directory and move `Jack.so` there:
```
mkdir ~/.gwplug
mv Jack.so ~/.gwplug
```
Repeat for the other plugins mentioned. The `Soundpipe` plugin requires the [gwion-soundpipe](https://github.com/Gwion/gwion-soundpipe) library, which we hope to have build seamlessly for you when you build the `Soundpipe` module, but we're not quite there yet. For now, please clone gwion-soundpipe in the Soundpipe plugin directory `plug/Soundpipe`. Please ask for help if this isn't working.

When all those plugin `.so` files are in your `~/.gwplug` directory, you should be able to run a Gwion program that makes sound! In `plug/Modules` there's a `test.gw` program which plays a sine wave for 5 seconds. If the `gwion` you built is still in the base dir of your cloned repo, from the
`plug/Modules` subdirectory you should be able to run `../../gwion -d Jack test.gw` and hear some sound!

## Installation

It's a good idea to install Gwion now that you have tried it out. Use the following command to install it:
```
sudo make install
```

To confirm Gwion can make sound, update `hello_world.gw` to:

```
#import Modules

<<<"Sound from Gwion!">>>;

new SinOsc ~> dac;

5::second => now;
```

To run it with Jack as the driver: `gwion hello_world.gw -dJack`. Hopefully you will hear a smooth sine wave. If not, please reach out on Discord and we'll help you out.

## Documentation

Run gwion with the --cdoc flag and it will show you everything that Gwion has to offer. Like so: 

`gwion --cdoc --color=always | less -R` 

Online documentation is a work in progress :construction_worker: You can [view it here](https://Gwion.github.io/Gwion/). Please consider contributing ðŸ™‚ 

If you need help with anything just [talk to us on Discord](https://discord.gg/KmHqbTKSmS). In general the audio programming community is very friendly and the people involved with Gwion are no exception.
